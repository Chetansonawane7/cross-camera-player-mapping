## 🎯 Task: Cross-Camera Player Mapping
Identify and consistently label players across two different camera feeds (`broadcast.mp4` and `tacticam.mp4`) of the same gameplay.

## ⚙️ Setup & Dependencies

Tested with:
- Python 3.9
- torch >= 2.1.0
- torchvision
- ultralytics
- opencv-python
- numpy
- tqdm
- scipy

Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

🚀 How to Run:
1. Detect and Crop Players:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Extract Embeddings:
   ```bash
   python extract_features.py
   ```
3. Match Players Between Videos:
   ```bash
   python match_players.py
   ```
4. Visualize Annotated Videos:
   ```bash
   python visualize_player_ids.py
   ```

📦 Output
player_matches.json: maps players between camera feeds
broadcast_annotated.mp4 and tacticam_annotated.mp4: videos with consistent IDs across views
Cropped player patches saved in crops/
Feature embeddings saved in features/

📌 Notes
A fixed cosine similarity threshold (0.8) was used for matching.
Some mismatches may occur due to occlusion, similar appearances, or lack of tracking.
Can be extended with global optimization (Hungarian algorithm), temporal smoothing, or tracking.

Let me know if you also want a `.pdf` version of the report or help generating `requirements.txt`. You're now fully ready to submit!
